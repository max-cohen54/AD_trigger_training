Please write short descriptions of each model you train. At minimum, list the model name, and a short description about it.

40MHZ_norm_DNN.keras
- a model trained on the 40MHZ challenge dataset pt normalized using the default settings

Different_40MHZ_VAE_Models contains many variations of a VAE trained on the 40MHZ dataset used to tets model architecture and performance 


Good_models is for specific models that are the best workign version of whatever model they are

-40_MHZ_VAE_beta_0.83_batchnorm is a VAE trained on the 40MHZ dataset which has the same structure as the 40MHZ paper model and comperable performance (this includes a batchnorm layer on the encoder)

-40_MHZ_VAE_beta_0.83_batchnorm_clipped_Kl is a VAE trained on the 40MHZ dataset which has the same structure as the 40MHZ paper model and comperable performance (this includes a batchnorm layer on the encoder) but is trained with the clipped KL loss insead of the full Kl loss
